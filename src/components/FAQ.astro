    question: "How much does car transport cost?",
    answer: "Costs vary based on distance, vehicle type, and service level (depot vs door). For example, short interstate hops might start from $400, while cross-country moves can range from $900+. Use our instant quote tool for an exact price."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does transport take?",
    answer: "Transit times depend on the route. East coast capitals (Syd-Melb-Bris) typically take 2-4 business days. Perth to East Coast can take 7-10 business days. We provide estimated windows upon booking."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",
    answer: "Yes, all our transport partners are fully insured. Your vehicle is covered for transit damage in accordance with Australian consumer law and our carrier terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I leave personal items in the car?",
    answer: "Generally, no. For safety and insurance reasons, vehicles must be empty of personal items. Some carriers allow up to 40kg in the boot/trunk at your own risk, but this must be confirmed prior to booking."
